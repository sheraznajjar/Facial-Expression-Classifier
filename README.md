# Facial Expression Classifier is a real-time emotion recognition project built using Googleâ€™s Teachable Machine. It classifies facial expressions into emotional categories such as happy and sad

This project aims to support emotional awareness and non-verbal communication understanding, especially in educational and psychological contexts. It can be used in classrooms, interactive apps, or awareness campaigns to help children and adults better recognize and respond to emotional cues in themselves and others.
